# RasPi_Speed_Monitor
This project will use a raspberry pi to monitor my internet speed. I will use InfluxDB and Grafana to store and graph the data. The speed test will be from Ooklaâ€™s speedtest https://www.speedtest.net/. The speed test will run by using a python script. This will output data as a csv file for monitoring my internet speeds. I will automate this process using a crontab so I can run it routinely for more accurate data. The source of this project is from https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-internet-speed-monitor
